Scenario 1
    1. Step Size, Block Size
    2. 0.0
    3. [Step Size, 1], [option, 1] 

Scenario 2
    1. 2
    2. MHHH
    3. 1.0

Scenario 3
    1. 0.5, 0, 0.5
    2. 32, 16
    3. 16
    4. Rep Count

Checkoff Question 1: Rep Count denote the count of sequentially write(option 0), so no memeory wiil be hit in scenario 1.
Checkoff Question 2: Step Size modification utilizes the spatial locality while option modification utilizes the temporal locality.
Checkoff Question 3: One compulsory miss is included in each block, and RW mode gives one hit. For 2 Step Size, will give 2 more hit thanks to spatial locality.
Checkoff Question 4: Cache Size is equal to Array Size, so after one iteration through the cache will get the all data need to be accessed.
Checkoff Question 5: Because each element in the array is independently processed, it is possible to iterative all function to one element then move on, i.e., switch the inner loop and outer loop.
Checkoff Question 6: When after one Rep Count iteration, L2 will get full copy of array, so Rep Count > 1 could make L2 hit rate increase and L1 hit rate stay the same.
