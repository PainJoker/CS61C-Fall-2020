Checkoff Question 1: Rep Count denote the count of sequentially write(option 0). No memory hits will occur in scenario 1.
Checkoff Question 2: Step Size modification leverages spatial locality while option modification leverages the temporal locality.
Checkoff Question 3: Each block incurs 1 compulsory miss and RW mode leads to one hit. With Step Size = 2, spatial locality provides 2 additional hits.
Checkoff Question 4: Cache Size equals Array Size, so after one full iteration, all reaquired data is cached.
Checkoff Question 5: Because each element in the array is independently processed, it is possible to iterate all function for one element first(i.e., swap inner and outer loops).
Checkoff Question 6: After one Rep Count iteration, L2 holds full copy of array. For Rep Count > 1, L2 hit rate increases due to reuse, while L1 hit rate remains unchanged.
