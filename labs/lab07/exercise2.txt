Checkoff Question 1: When using i as the innermost loop in the computation C[i+j*n] += A[i+k*n] * B[k+j*n], it optimizes cache utilization. Spatial locality is achieved for C and A, while temporal locality benefits B
Checkoff Question 2: Contrary to CQ1, j is used in the innermost loop, it severely degrades spatial locality, accesses to C and B become non-contiguous and performance will get worse when n exceeds the cache block size.
Checkoff Question 3: The order of outer loop will slightly affect the performance when hit rate is high, large-stride dimensions in outer loops may improve prefetching efficiency. But in low hit rate, memory bandwidth becomes the bottleneck, making loop order irrelevant.
